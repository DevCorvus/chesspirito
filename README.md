# Chesspirito

Simple Chess Engine + UI (Chessboard) made just for fun as a casual chess player myself. No dependencies, only Vite for DX.

## Context

Never planned to run a chess bot so I followed the KISS principle all the way down which means there's almost not a single glimpse of optimization or cleverness  coming out of this code. It's straight and simple, a 2D array representation of the board _kinda_ following most chess rules and notation. It was a lot of fun! I even "designed" the pieces (yes, those ugly pieces) and came out of this as a _slightly_ better chess player.

Btw, some of those missing rules/features are the fifty-move rule, threefold repetition, insufficient material or improving things like following SAN notation 100%, proper fen importer/exporter, optimizations and implement a chess bot with its due API.
